                    If you're anything like me, during the pandemic you've discovered how much you hate trying to decide on what to make for dinner! What do I want? What do I have in the house? I just end up eating something to get rid of my hunger. But I want it to be more fun! So I came up with this website to help us find recipes from all over the world, to literally spice up our lives! Since we're very new, we only have a few reccipes and cuisines, but we're growing by the day and you can add recipes of your own!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get started, you can click on the links to left to either begin by looking at all available cuisines, or looking at every available recipe.
                </p>
                <p>Happy Cooking!</p>
